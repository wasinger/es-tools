PHP Helpers for Elasticsearch
====================================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/wasinger/es-tools.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/wasinger/es-tools)

This repository will contain some useful convenience classes for working with the official Elasticsearch PHP Client, which is a rather lowlevel tool.

The tools in this repo are primarily written for my personal use but may be helpful for others too.
